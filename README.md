# -AI-Powered-Personalized-Travel-Itinerary-Generator
Objective of the AI-Powered Personalized Travel Itinerary Generator:

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack web application that solves a real-world problem (travel planning) by combining cutting-edge technologies like AI, APIs, and databases. Here’s a breakdown of the objectives:

1. Automate Personalized Travel Planning
Problem Solved: Traditional travel planning is time-consuming and generic.

Solution: Use AI (OpenAI) to generate unique, tailored itineraries based on user preferences (budget, interests, travel dates).

Example:

If a user loves hiking and local food, the AI suggests hidden trails and authentic restaurants.

2. Integrate Real-Time Data via APIs
Problem Solved: Static itineraries don’t account for dynamic factors like weather or local events.

Solution: Fetch real-time data from APIs to enhance recommendations:

Weather API: Warn users if it’ll rain during their hike.

Google Places API: Show nearby attractions, cafes, or museums.

Event APIs: Suggest concerts/festivals happening during their trip.
